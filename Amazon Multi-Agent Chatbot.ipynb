This phone seems to meet your needs.<br /><br />The phone's price was right and setup was easy. Best setup process I've ever experieced with a cellphone/PDA, thanks in large part to google backup, cloud, etc. I'd guess a person familiar with cellphones and tablets using Android could set this phone up in 20 minutes. But the A52 also seems intuitive and there was no glitches that ate up hours figuring out. This is a very positive start. I'll come back later and update after using the phone for a few months.<br /><br />For now, know that Amazon delivered on time, the phones appear to be new as promised and were not difficult to set up.\n","- This is a quality mid priced phone. Lots of amenities. You would be hard pressed to buy a phone that is appreciably better, regardless of price. The only drawback is that it arrived in a hard to decipher foreign language.  But once I was able to get past that all is well. A really good phone. The price is right. If you're having troubles trying to purchase a phone , check this one out\n","- I expected brand new, but received old and used phone. It works find so far. There is a scratch and dent on the back of the phone. There is also a problem with the battery. It doesn't last long and the phone getting hot. I feel like I am cheated. I wish I could return it, but my flight to backhome overseas will be tomorrow. 😢\n","- My daughter bought one of these last year to use with our AT&T account. AT&T just shut off their 3G network and now the phone cannot make or receive phone calls. Went to the ATT store and the said that because it's the International version, it will not work with their 4G towers. Basically it is now useless to use as a phone. Otherwise everything else works great :(\n","- Up and running in minutes. Love the camera quality. Overall, excellent phone\n","- Excelente celular,<br />Pero se friza mucho<br />Y no se le puede quitar la data\n","- When you turn on the phone show the \"samsung galaxy\" logo instead of \"samsung galaxy a52\", the screen is diagonal when the manufacturer claims that 6.5\" does not correspond to reality, I took a tape measure and checked that the screen is 6.25\".  my old phone samsung a21s has a screen diagonal of 6.5 \"which is more screen than on samsung a52. a phone with two sim cards can be used under the condition without a flash card. or you can use one sim card and a flash card. but the phone is good, which I liked\n","- I was looking for a phone for my son and didn't want to spend a lot of money. It works great, the set up was very easy. It's easy to navigate, has good battery power. This was a good purchase.\n","- [[VIDEOID:4b08c923329f31f1a089e0c9eab6f2a7]] I ordered a factory unlocked samsung galaxy A52 and I just turned it on and has a passcode, so I can't return it because it arrived on march and I can't use it because I cannot turn it off...it asks for the passcode (wich I don't have) and a bixby voice to turn it off... I REALLY need help with this...PLEASE!\n","- This one is to be used in another country. Very pleased with product. The phone comes with a screen protector installed and there is a clear cover included in the box.\n","- So far so good arrived a day late but got here, screen has no scratches body has no blemishes  and it seems to have 8gb of ram instead of 6gb.\n","- i liked that it came fast that it was new in the box and it has a lot of space on it what i did not like was the phone did not want too transfer my info to the new one well i got about half of it from google account the rest i will have to do this seams like a good phone but i don't know it is 2 days old now i may update later on....\n","- I have used this cell phone form almost 1 week and so far it runs smooth I will give more details the longer I use it, so far its a good buy for 300 dollars\n","- It's ok but going in it its feel like it was use before\n","- Worst phone I ever owned. So user unfriendly.  Gotta look up everything!!! How to save messages? How to change font size? Etc, etc, etc\n","- Phone case is ok but when on a hands free speaker call everyone kept saying they couldn't hear me properly. I would have to shout or take phone off speaker. Phone case muffled sound\n","- Product not compatible with att network now that they shut off 3g\n","- I upgraded from a J7 Prime to the A52 and I absolutely love it. Especially the camera. I still use Nova Launcher and it has extra features. It's worth the buy. Fast charging as well.\n","- Some of these reviewers are ridiculous! If you don’t know how to handle an android or Samsung phone, don’t buy it! It’s the best bang for your buck. Same specs as an iPhone 13 but cheaper and has a SD card slot for extra memory. I was going to get an s22 but it doesn’t have an SD card slot so it was a solid no. Samsung phones always have nice cameras and takes good photos. Just make sure your cell phone company is compatible before use and you’ll be set! Also, please note this phone has no US warranty so if you’re ok with that then this is the phone for you. I tried to see if it did but it doesn’t come with one. And as always, look at seller rating before you buy from them! It’s called common sense people!!!\n","- This fone doesn't have a split screen where you can view 2 apps at once\n","- El telefono no es malo, solo que para trasmitir mi GPS a la pantalla del auto se torna lento el GPS... fuera de eso que es super importante pata mi! El lector de huella no funciona cuando esta en el soporte de celular de mi carro Tenaz! En ocasiones el teclado no salia y no me dejaba escribir nada, tenia que reiniciar el teléfono... perdida de tiempo y yo trabajo con el! En conclusion malo!\n","- This is a good phone....the battery life is good the space and storage true to whats mentioned in description....camera quality is also ok\n","- Used it 1 week, humidity senzor is on. The phone was nowhere next to water....\n","- I bought 2 phone for my family. This phone came all dirty and filled with fingerprints on it. Does not look like it's a new phone compared to the other.\n","- This is my first smartphone with a large display. I do really like it. I also like that it has a headphone jack. All the apps I use run well on it. The camera on the phone is great too. It has portrait mode on the selfie camera and the shots come out great.\n","- Aug 20th 2022: Replacement worked for a day then stopped. Called Amazon for help and returned it for a refund. Got a new brand phone. Have used Samsung since 2015, I won't be going back to them after this.<br />---<br />July 24th 2022: Started having problems with my phone. Turns out to be the chip reader. It's broken. Just 3 months and it's broken. Contacted Amazon, sending a replacement. Will try for 4 months and come back with an update. Down to 1 star<br />---<br />May 6th-7th 2022: I got this to replace my old samsung. My provider is Metro PC and I was able to swap my sims card over. Granted I had to call and have them do it over the phone, it still worked out! Cameras are great too. Wanted a good camera phone. 5 stars\n","- it will not work in the United States. when they refund back  the purchase ,they charge you $142.16 restocking fee.TOTAL RIP OFF. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.\n","- This phone is not compatible with my service. Although in the description it says otherwise. This is very much an inconvenience. Now I have to purchase another phone\n","- Bought this for my brother who has Cricket wireless service on recent reviews it said compatible but that wasn’t the case it worked for a few hours then the service was suspended was very confused being that same phone was $450 in the cricket store but saved over $100 buying it here they mentioned it was because of the double slim card slots but his current phone has 2 also so that made no sense then they said because it had 2 IMEI’s so now he is currently stuck with his old phone until further notice\n","- The phone is a solid middle of the road phone and everything works as it should.  My biggest problem has been finding a dependable service provider in my area.  It would not work on straight talk, or any Verizon or AT&T towers in my area, only on T Mobile and they have poor coverage where I am located.  The phone works wonderfully on wi-fi although I wish I had gotten a 5 g phone but am having a hard time finding a good service provider.  My next try will be with either Google fi or Mint Mobile to see if they can get a signal to talk and text on\n","- I'm returning this item because it says it works with AT&T but it doesn't I'm expecting to get a full refund but we will see, as there is a waiting period.\n","- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK ON AT&T NETWORK IN THE US.\n","- This phone was sold to us as a 4G phone, moreover it was on the original list of compatible phones with AT&T network after the switchover to 5G. We bought it in July 2021 and it worked fine until three days ago. Now we can't get it registered on the network. AT&T tech support is stumped. They say the IMEI number is correct and the sim card number is correct. They suggested we take it to the AT&T store to get a new sim card. We did that and it still doesn't work. The staff at the store says that is because it is a 3G phone. Samsung rolled out a software update this month. Is that the problem? Is there a patch to make it compatible with AT&T again?\n","- Buen teléfono, se entregó en buen estado, todo nuevo.<br />El único inconveniente es que cuando se pidió no lo entregaron porque se perdió pero al poner la queja lo repusieron en tiempo mínimo, así que todo bien.\n","- Excelente articulo, se conectó a la red de El Salvador inmediatamente le puse el SIM.\n","- Works well.  The operating system is easy to manipulate to my needs.  I use it for work, and the battery easily lasts all day.  The speakers are clear.\n","- I was really hesitant in buying this phone because of some reviews saying they were selling used phones etc. But I realized that the selling page is the same but there are different seller providers. Beware of that. Some sellers will use the same ASIN number of other companies to trick you in buying theirs. Those sellers have really bad reviews in general. I searched one that had almost only good reviews and bought from them. Received my new cellphone with everything working perfectly !<br />Keep in mind that the charger is the international one, not the USA one. Great phone!\n","- Not happy with the seller, as they didn't reveal that the phone was a European model!  It only presented minor inconveniences due mostly to my illiteracy when it comes to technology.  However, the charger was another story, as it came with a European plug!  I had to purchase a plug adapter.\n","- Not worth the value, too big and heavy, all the supposed photo quality improvements of this phone are not evident nor visible. Processor, memory and screen are quite good in comparison to my previous Moto phone, but not such an improvement in comparison with the additional cost I paid.\n","- It stated that it was a new phone.  The Samsung packing seals were already broken.  Ok but then it also had a previous pass code on the phone.  So I could not even unlock the phone at all.\n","- I got this phone for my older parents. The large screen is nice, UI is fast and smooth. I turned down the animation to 0.5x in the developer mode to make scrolling/using faster. They are happy. No complaints!\n","- This phone is only 3G/2G service which means in some places the reception is terrible !!! I work in San Francisco and the reception on my phone is always low which means I can't get signal. I wish I would have known this before I bought it, I feel like I deserve a partial refund ?\n","- The color is awesome and the camera's are fantastic. The price was so much better than going to AT&T or another carrier. AT&T wanted over $100 more and stated I could not buy the phone outright.\n","- The phone did not come with a Sim card or a SD card .  Sent it back\n","- The phone came brand new and sealed. The charger is for another country. I just use my old samsung charger. No problems. The phone is fast. The screen is clear and bright. In the mid range phone market the a52 is hard to beat. The processor is fast, the refresh rate is fast, and the phone is all around nice. But what really sealed the deal for me is Samsung's update policy. They guarantee Android and security updates for a few years. I forget exactly how many years, but this was one major factor that won me over to purchasing a Samsung device over any other brand.\n","- 4 months and this week home stop working black screen saying no network purchased from the mercate group buyer beware 4 months It stopped working\n","- I was happy with this phone for 2 months. Now my phone will not call out or receive calls. I have had 4 different people work on it and Noone can fix it. No warranty. Only for 1 month. Don't buy this.\n","- This phone is a great value.  I replaced my S9+ with this phone and so far, it's been worth it.  Great price, good performance.  It's just a hair slower than my S9+ and feels slightly heavier.  Wish it had wireless charging, but a minor detail.  For the money spent, I'm very happy with the overall performance, quality build, battery life, screen, and camera.  Highly recommended.\n","- This phone worked fine until my phone did a software update. This is a 3G phone. Very dissatisfied!\n","- I bought this phone in April thinking that it would work with my carrier, AT&T. It worked fine for 3 months. Then AT&T did an automated software/system update and the \"phone\" feature stopped working. Can't receive or make calls, which makes the phone useless.  After spending much time talking with, and online communicating with AT&T  they tell me the the reason is that they no longer support this phone in 4G.  So if you're buying this and your carrier is AT&T, DON'T buy it.\n","- The phone is good but had to pay my carrier to used it with them but other than that the phone works good will write another review if anything happens\n","- Was having issues with my first phone so I had a replacement sent out, everything was fine with the phone until I moved which was right around the corner from my old place, now the phone isn't picking up any reception at all, I was missing calls and notifications and didn't know it for 2 weeks, now I have no use for the phone and can't return it because it's past the return period...it was a waste of money and I can't do anything about it but try to sell the phone...so irritating.\n","- Phone had no issues until 2 weeks ago that my carrier closed their 3g network, I stopped receiving any calls and texts since this phone doesn't connect to 4g or 5g network, all carriers seem to be the same way and there is no fix to this problem.\n","- This phone doesn't work at all for me, so I'm stuck with my Galaxy S10. But I rated it 4 stars because it's still a good phone, not their fault for my mistake. I used to be a Sprint customer (CDMA network) before they got bought out and merged with T-Mobile (GSM). Although my current phone gets service from T-Mobile, it won't let me activate this device because my account login still leads to the Sprint website. Guess I'm out $245 now, but you live and you learn I guess.\n","- Seller: Phone_Zone<br /><br />The warranty for this device is only 30 days so if your phone craps out after 31 days - you're screwed which is what happened to me.  6 weeks only & phone call/receive function STOPPED after an update. Text, email, internet was fine but could not use phone for its PRIMARY use!  Amazon does not stand behind its personal electronics so expect ZERO customer service after only 4 weeks.  Ebay  once honored a cellphone return after 60 days so going forward will purchase from Ebay only.  30 day policy is fine for a shirt but NOT a piece of expensive electronics which is DEFECTIVE thru no fault of the customer.<br />BUYER BEWARE.\n","- I bought this phone Samsung A52 and did not accept any incoming calls, after trying everything with the carrier I asked for a replacement and same problem happened. When I contacted Samsung Care I spoke to the worst tech called Mohamed Naveed Ahmed who simply messed up all my accounts held for 2 hours to say to return the phone to the seller, the worst customer service from Samsung Care.\n","- The phone was working pretty well, until the most recent update by Samsung. I stopped receiving calls and texts! I contacted my carrier and we did a lot of troubleshooting but nothing worked even after replacing the Sim card! Nothing worked until I used my Sim card on a different phone. It's strange that Samsung takes much time to resolve this\u001b[0m\n","Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3m**Pros:**\n","1.
